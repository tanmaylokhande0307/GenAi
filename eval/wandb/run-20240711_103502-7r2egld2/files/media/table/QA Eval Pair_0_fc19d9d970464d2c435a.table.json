Additionally, techniques like dropout can be utilized to create two differing latent representations within a single input.", "gemini-pro"], ["How does multi-crop increase the number of positive pairs for a given image, and how does this benefit training performance?", "Multi-crop increases the number of positive pairs by introducing smaller crops (96x96) on top of the usual two large ones (224x224). Instead of only comparing the two large crops together, or all pairs of crops, the two large crops are each compared to all other crops (big or small). This results in 2(N-1) times more invariance loss computations, increasing the positive-pair related signal. The use of smaller crops and not comparing all pairs of crops helps reduce computational cost. While additional crops can increase training time and memory usage, it generally leads to better performance.", "gemini-pro"], ["Which paper proposed BEiT (BEiT-Baseline Image Transformer), which uses a discrete visual token-based prediction instead of a pixel-level reconstruction loss?", "BEiT was proposed by Bao et al. in 2021a.
