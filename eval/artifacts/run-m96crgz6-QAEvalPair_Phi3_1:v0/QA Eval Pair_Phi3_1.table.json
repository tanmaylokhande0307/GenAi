Specifically, using FFCV-SSL (8GPU and resolution from 160 -> 224), SimCLR achieved high validation accuracies on ImageNet in less than two days with a single GPU or just few hours utilizing eight GPUs.", "phi3"], ["What are some of the approaches mentioned in improving representation learning with SSL (Self-Supervised Learning) methods?", "Several studies have proposed various ways to enhance representation learning using Self-Supervised Learning, or SSL. Guo et al., for instance, introduced BYOL-Explore that uses the BYOL method by Grill et al., but includes exploration as an objective where disagreement in forward models is used. Jarrett and colleagues tackled a specific issue of BYOL-Explore getting stuck on noisy TV signals with their work. Yarats et al. suggested using clustering methods similar to SwAV (Caron et al., 2020) for unsupervised exploration, which relies only on intrinsic rewards without external labels or annotations.", "phi3"], ["What is the connection identified by Huang et al.
