### Neural Network
Neural network is a machine learning model that uses a layered structure of interconnected nodes to process data and solve problem similar to how human brain works

Imagine each neuron as a function which takes in the output from all the neurons from its previous layer and spit out a number between 0 and 1

weight and biases


initiate with random weight and bias

network learning means minimize the value of cost function

Backpropagation is an algorithm to determine how a single training example should nudge the weights and baises of the network to decrease the cost
